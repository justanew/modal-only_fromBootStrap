The reason for this site is to create a modal only jquery plugin from boot strap. I think that this should be easy because the boot strap code is set up so individule modules can be used as jquery plugins it is just doing it and testing to make sure it works.

I will be using it in WordPress and was thinking of just putting it in the js code that wordpress loads in in the beginning. 
Some one has probably done this but I didn't see it when i did a quick look.
This will be used in conjunction with the wp plugin I and working on for Bible and CCC quotes.
